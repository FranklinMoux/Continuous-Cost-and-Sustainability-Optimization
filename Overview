# Syntax.

A tasty treats podcast for Web Developers.

This is the site that runs [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) â€” go there to listen to it!

This site is built on React and Next.js

## Requirements
- Node 8.1.2 or higher

## Development

First you `npm install`

Then you `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:6969`.

Then you do some work.

When you are ready for prime time, you can just submit a PR to this repo and it will be deployed once it's accepted.

If you want to build your own version, just run `npm run build` and then I'd recommend deploying with `now`.
